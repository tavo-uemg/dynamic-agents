This directory contains the Alembic migration environment used by the project.

The configuration has been set up for async SQLAlchemy engines; run commands
with the usual Alembic CLI (e.g. `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "..."`
and `alembic upgrade head`). The actual metadata is exposed through
`dynamic_agents.models`.
